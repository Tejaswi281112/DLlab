(i) Construct a vector consisting of the first 24 integers using NumPy.
python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
vector = np.arange(1, 25)
print("Vector:", vector)
(ii) Convert that NumPy vector into a tensor of rank 3.
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
tensor_3d = tf.convert_to_tensor(vector, dtype=tf.int32)
tensor_3d = tf.reshape(tensor_3d, (2, 3, 4))
print("3D Tensor:\n", tensor_3d)
(iii) Observations on how the elements of the rank 3 tensor vector got rearranged.

Edit
The tensor has 2 matrices of shape (3, 4). The first 12 elements fill the first matrix, and the next 12 elements fill the second matrix.
(iv) Get the version of TensorFlow running on your machine.
python
Copy
Edit
print("TensorFlow Version:", tf.__version__)
(v) Get the type, number of physical devices available on your machine, and test whether the GPU is available.
python
Copy
Edit
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
print("Number of Physical Devices:", len(physical_devices))
for device in physical_devices:
    print(device)

gpu_available = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpu_available:
    print("GPU Available:", gpu_available[0].name)
else:
    print("No GPU available.")
(vi) What is the need for setting a seed value in any random number generation?

Edit
Setting a seed ensures reproducibility of random number generation, which is important for consistency in experiments and debugging.
